# house-price-ml
Machine Learning project for predicting house prices with multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  Includes performance evaluation and visualizations (Actual vs Predicted, Residuals, Model Comparison, Feature Importance).
# 🧠 Machine Learning Model Visualization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **end-to-end machine learning workflow** including:  
- Data preprocessing and scaling  
- Training multiple regression models  
- Evaluating performance using R², RMSE, and MAE  
- Visualizing results with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**  
- Comparing models side by side  
- Feature importance analysis for tree-based models  
- Neural Network (ANN) implementation with PyTorch  

The goal is to provide a **complete ML project template** that can be reused and extended.
